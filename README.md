## Installation

### Option 1: Load as Unpacked Extension (Developer Mode)

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" button
5. Select the `extension` folder from this project
6. The AutoPurge extension should now appear in your extensions list

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Download the extension files
2. Create a new folder for the extension
3. Copy all files from the `extension` directory to your folder
4. Follow the steps above to load as unpacked extension

## Permissions Explained

The extension requires the following permissions:

- **history**: To delete specific URLs from your browsing history
- **storage**: To save your settings and domain lists locally
- **tabs**: To monitor tab changes and navigation events
- **webNavigation**: To detect when you visit or leave pages
- **host_permissions**: To monitor HTTP/HTTPS websites (excludes chrome://, file://, etc.)

## How It Works

1. **Domain Monitoring**: The extension monitors your web navigation for domains in your configured lists
2. **Delay Timer**: When you visit a matching domain, a deletion timer starts
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: After the configured delay (default 10 seconds), the URL is removed from Chrome history
4. **Debouncing**: Multiple visits to the same URL are deduplicated to avoid excessive deletions

## Configuration

- **Deletion Delay**: Choose between 3, 10, or 30 seconds
- **Custom Domains**: Add your own domains (up to 10 on free plan)

### Domain Management

- **Custom Domains**: Add domains like `example.com` (matches subdomains automatically)
- **Domain Validation**: Ensures proper domain format before adding

### Quick Cleanup
